# Frank Cloud Networking Portfolio

## About This Repository
This repository documents my journey from **Network Administrator** to **Cloud Network Engineer**, combining hands-on labs, network automation, cloud infrastructure design, and network security practices. It serves as both a **learning archive** and a **professional portfolio** to demonstrate my technical skills, automation projects, and real-world scenarios.
